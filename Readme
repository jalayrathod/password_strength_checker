~To understand the characteristics of a strong password, evaluate various passwords using
online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com), and summarize best
practices for secure password creation.

~Tested Passwords::
1. Password: 123456
Complexity Features: Only digits, short
Score (PasswordMeter): 4%
Feedback Summary: Very weak, common

2. Password: password
Complexity Features: Lowercase only
Score (PasswordMeter): 8%
Feedback Summary: Very weak, dictionary word

3. Password: Password1
Complexity Features: Uppercase, lowercase, digit
Score (PasswordMeter): 54%
Feedback Summary: Moderate, still predictable

4. Password: P@ssw0rd!
Complexity Features: Uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol
Score (PasswordMeter): 84%
Feedback Summary: Strong, some patterns

5. Password: G^u7!B#e9x@V1
Complexity Features: All character types, 13 characters
Score (PasswordMeter): 100%
Feedback Summary: Excellent, very strong

~Best Password Much Contain The Following Thing:
1.Length: At least 12–16 characters.

2.Complexity: Mix of:
Uppercase (A–Z)
Lowercase (a–z)
Numbers (0–9)
Special characters (!@#$%^&*)

3.Unpredictability: Avoid dictionary words, names, or obvious substitutions (e.g., P@ssw0rd).

4.No repetition or sequences: Avoid 1234, aaaa, or abcd.

~Things That I Learned From Evaluation::
Use passphrases with random words and symbols (e.g., Frog!Candle77$JumpSky).
                    
Avoid personal information (names, birthdates).
                    
Password managers can generate and store strong passwords securely.
                    
Regularly update passwords, especially for sensitive accounts.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

~Some Of The Common Password Attacks::
1.Brute Force::Tries all possible combinations until the password is cracked. Time-
consuming but effective against short or simple passwords.
                    
2.Dictionary Attack::	Uses a list of common passwords or words from the dictionary. Fast
and effective against weak or reused passwords.                    
                    
3.Credential Stuffing::	Reuses leaked username-password pairs from other sites. Highlights
the importance of unique passwords per site.

~Complexity Affects Security::
Longer and more complex passwords increase the time and effort required for brute-
force or dictionary attacks.

A password like 123456 can be cracked in milliseconds.

A password like G^u7!B~e9x@V1 would take billions of years with current technology
to crack via brute force.
